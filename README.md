## DTDY : Do That Dish Yourself
### WINNER of UB Hack 2018 : Best use of Sponsor API

### Project: [https://devpost.com/software/dtdy-do-that-dish-yourself](https://devpost.com/software/dtdy-do-that-dish-yourself)

### Idea
The idea was to incorporate the **Clarifai**'s Image Recognition API and **Wegman**'s API to build a "Recipe Prediction" mobile app. The person clicks the photograph of a dish and supply it to the Clarifai API which cross-references its prediction of the dish against the recipes available in the Wegmans database.

The user gets the following information:
1. a list of closest matching recipes with cooking direction,
2. Nutritional value of the ingredients used
3. Estimated cost of purchasing the ingredients
4. The nearest store where the ingredients are available.

The API was hosted on the **Google Cloud Platform** and the app was designed for **Android**.
